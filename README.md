# Postscript
Some of my Postscript (the printer language) projects - some early, some less so. `zut` means pile of rubbish. There's lots to do with polysymmetry and fractals, and then some other stuff. Postscript is actually a really fun language for static graphics programming - I love its syntax, model of stack frames (you have to manually push a new local namespace dictionary to the stack). It's powerful - featuring programmatic features like for loops, while maintaining good drawing primitives and vector graphics. It's actually pretty good for fractals, but also polysymmetric tilings and more. Here are a couple of my favourites:

A few more that I really wanted to add here, but have moved to a directory of SVGs (they should be viewable in browser): [svgs](https://github.com/elterminad0r/Postscript/blob/master/svgs/)
